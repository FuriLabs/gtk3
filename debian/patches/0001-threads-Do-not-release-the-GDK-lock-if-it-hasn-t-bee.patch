Subject: [PATCH] threads: Do not release the GDK lock if it hasn't been
 acquired yet
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since GLib ≥ 2.41, attempting to release an unlocked mutex will abort(),
as it happens on most systems already.

Given the lack of proper documentation on how to use GDK with threads,
there is code in the wild that does:

    gdk_threads_init ();
    gdk_init ();

    ...

    gtk_main ();

instead of the idiomatically correct:

    gdk_threads_init ();
    gdk_threads_enter ();

    gtk_init ();

    ...

    gtk_main ();

    ...

    gdk_threads_leave ();

Which means that gtk_main() will try to release the GDK lock, and thus
trigger an error from GLib.

we cannot really fix all the wrong code everywhere, and since it does
not cost us anything, we can work around the issue inside GDK itself, by
trying to acquire the GDK lock inside gdk_threads_leave() with
trylock().
